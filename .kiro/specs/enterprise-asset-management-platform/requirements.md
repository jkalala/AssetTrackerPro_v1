# Enterprise Asset Management Platform - Requirements Document

## Introduction

AssetTracker Pro is positioned to compete directly with established players like AssetTrackPro.com by transforming from a functional prototype into a comprehensive, enterprise-ready asset management platform. This transformation requires addressing critical gaps in security, compliance, scalability, and enterprise features while maintaining the strong foundation already built.

The platform will serve businesses, universities, government agencies, and NGOs with professional-grade asset tracking, lifecycle management, and operational intelligence capabilities.
