# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The E2E authentication tests are failing because the expected UI elements, pages, and functionality are either missing or don't match what the tests expect. This feature will implement the missing authentication-related pages and components to make the E2E tests pass, ensuring proper API authentication, MFA setup, session management, rate limiting, SSO authentication, security event logging, and tenant isolation functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage API keys through a comprehensive UI, so that I can control programmatic access to the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to `/settings/api-keys` THEN the system SHALL display an "API Keys" page with proper heading
2. WHEN I click "Create API Key" button THEN the system SHALL show a form with key name and permissions fields
3. WHEN I fill in key details and submit THEN the system SHALL create an API key starting with "ak_" prefix
4. WHEN an API key is created THEN the system SHALL display it with `data-testid="api-key-value"` attribute
5. WHEN API key creation succeeds THEN the system SHALL show a success message with class "success-message"
6. WHEN I create an API key THEN the system SHALL allow setting permissions for assets read/write operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set up multi-factor authentication through the security settings, so that I can secure my account with 2FA.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to `/settings/security` THEN the system SHALL display "Security Settings" page
2. WHEN I click "Enable Two-Factor Authentication" button THEN the system SHALL show MFA setup modal with `data-testid="mfa-setup-modal"`
3. WHEN I select "Authenticator App" THEN the system SHALL display QR code with `data-testid="qr-code"` and manual secret with `data-testid="manual-secret"`
4. WHEN I enter verification code and click "Verify and Enable" THEN the system SHALL show backup codes with `data-testid="backup-codes"`
5. WHEN I complete MFA setup THEN the system SHALL show MFA status as "Enabled" with `data-testid="mfa-status"`
6. WHEN MFA is enabled THEN the system SHALL require MFA for subsequent logins

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my active sessions, so that I can monitor and control access to my account from different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to `/settings/sessions` THEN the system SHALL display "Active Sessions" page
2. WHEN the sessions page loads THEN the system SHALL show session list with `data-testid="session-list"`
3. WHEN viewing sessions THEN the system SHALL highlight current session with `data-testid="current-session"`
4. WHEN I click terminate session button THEN the system SHALL show confirmation dialog
5. WHEN I confirm session termination THEN the system SHALL display success message "Session terminated"
6. WHEN sessions are managed THEN the system SHALL update the session list in real-time

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the API, I want to see appropriate rate limiting messages, so that I understand when I've exceeded usage limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API rate limit is exceeded THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 429 status code
2. WHEN rate limit is hit THEN the system SHALL display error message containing "Rate limit exceeded"
3. WHEN rate limit error occurs THEN the system SHALL show "Try again in" message with retry time
4. WHEN rate limit headers are present THEN the system SHALL include X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, and X-RateLimit-Reset headers
5. WHEN refresh data button is clicked and rate limited THEN the system SHALL show rate limit error in UI
6. WHEN rate limit is active THEN the system SHALL prevent further API calls until reset time

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using SSO providers, so that I can use my organization's identity management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to `/login` THEN the system SHALL display "Sign in with SAML" button
2. WHEN I click SSO login button THEN the system SHALL redirect to SSO provider
3. WHEN SSO authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL redirect to `/auth/callback` with code and state parameters
4. WHEN SSO callback is processed THEN the system SHALL redirect to `/dashboard`
5. WHEN SSO authentication completes THEN the system SHALL show user menu with `data-testid="user-menu"`
6. WHEN SSO is configured THEN the system SHALL support SAML-based authentication flow

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view security events and audit logs, so that I can monitor system security and investigate incidents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I navigate to `/admin/security-events` as admin THEN the system SHALL display "Security Events" page
2. WHEN security events page loads THEN the system SHALL show events table with `data-testid="events-table"`
3. WHEN viewing events THEN the system SHALL display different event types with `data-testid="event-type-{type}"` format
4. WHEN I filter by event type THEN the system SHALL show only matching events
5. WHEN I reset filters THEN the system SHALL show all events again
6. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log login_success, login_failure, and mfa_success events

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a tenant user, I want my data to be isolated from other tenants, so that I can only access my organization's information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display my tenant name with `data-testid="tenant-name"`
2. WHEN I try to access another tenant's data THEN the system SHALL return "Unauthorized" response
3. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL enforce tenant isolation based on user's tenant_id
4. WHEN user belongs to tenant A THEN the system SHALL only show tenant A's data
5. WHEN direct URL access to other tenant data is attempted THEN the system SHALL block access
6. WHEN tenant context is established THEN the system SHALL maintain isolation throughout the session
