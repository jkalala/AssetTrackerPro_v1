# Code Quality and Lint Cleanup Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses the comprehensive cleanup of over 1000 ESLint warnings and errors across the AssetTracker Pro codebase. The goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and developer experience by systematically resolving all lint issues while ensuring no functionality is broken.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: TypeScript Type Safety Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript types throughout the codebase so that I can catch errors at compile time and have better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing TypeScript files THEN all `any` types SHALL be replaced with specific, appropriate types
2. WHEN examining function parameters THEN all parameters SHALL have explicit type annotations where TypeScript cannot infer them
3. WHEN working with API responses THEN proper interface definitions SHALL be created for all data structures
4. WHEN using external libraries THEN proper type imports SHALL be used instead of `any` fallbacks

### Requirement 2: Unused Code Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove all unused imports, variables, and functions so that the codebase is clean and bundle sizes are optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning imports THEN all unused imports SHALL be removed from files
2. WHEN reviewing variables THEN all unused variables SHALL be removed or prefixed with underscore if intentionally unused
3. WHEN examining function parameters THEN unused parameters SHALL be removed or prefixed with underscore
4. WHEN checking component props THEN all unused props SHALL be removed from component definitions

### Requirement 3: React Hooks Dependency Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all React hooks to have correct dependencies so that components behave predictably and avoid stale closure bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using useEffect hooks THEN all dependencies SHALL be properly included in the dependency array
2. WHEN using useCallback hooks THEN all dependencies SHALL be correctly specified
3. WHEN using useMemo hooks THEN all dependencies SHALL be accurately listed
4. WHEN dependencies change frequently THEN useCallback or useMemo wrappers SHALL be applied to stabilize references

### Requirement 4: Next.js Best Practices Compliance

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to follow Next.js best practices so that performance is optimized and SEO is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating navigation links THEN Next.js Link component SHALL be used instead of anchor tags for internal routes
2. WHEN displaying images THEN Next.js Image component SHALL be used instead of img tags where appropriate
3. WHEN handling routing THEN proper Next.js routing patterns SHALL be followed
4. WHEN implementing API routes THEN Next.js API route conventions SHALL be adhered to

### Requirement 5: HTML Entity and Accessibility Fixes

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper HTML rendering and accessibility so that the application works correctly across all browsers and assistive technologies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying text with special characters THEN proper HTML entities SHALL be used
2. WHEN creating interactive elements THEN proper ARIA labels and roles SHALL be included
3. WHEN building forms THEN proper form validation and error handling SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN using quotes and apostrophes THEN they SHALL be properly escaped in JSX

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Code Robustness

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling throughout the application so that users receive meaningful feedback and debugging is easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN catching errors THEN error variables SHALL be used or explicitly ignored with underscore prefix
2. WHEN handling async operations THEN proper error boundaries SHALL be in place
3. WHEN processing user input THEN validation and sanitization SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN making API calls THEN timeout and retry logic SHALL be considered

### Requirement 7: Interface and Type Definition Cleanup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clean and meaningful interface definitions so that the codebase is self-documenting and type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining interfaces THEN empty interfaces SHALL be avoided or properly extended
2. WHEN creating type definitions THEN they SHALL be specific and meaningful
3. WHEN using generic types THEN proper constraints SHALL be applied
4. WHEN importing types THEN they SHALL be imported as types, not values

### Requirement 8: Build and CI/CD Integration

**User Story:** As a team member, I want lint checks integrated into the build process so that code quality is maintained automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the build process THEN lint checks SHALL pass without warnings
2. WHEN committing code THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL validate code quality
3. WHEN creating pull requests THEN CI/CD pipeline SHALL enforce lint standards
4. WHEN deploying THEN the application SHALL build successfully with zero lint warnings

### Requirement 9: Documentation and Code Comments

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear documentation for complex code sections so that maintenance and onboarding are easier.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering complex business logic THEN explanatory comments SHALL be added
2. WHEN creating utility functions THEN JSDoc comments SHALL be provided
3. WHEN implementing workarounds THEN the reason SHALL be documented
4. WHEN using TypeScript ignore comments THEN they SHALL be replaced with proper type definitions where possible

### Requirement 10: Performance and Bundle Optimization

**User Story:** As an end user, I want fast application loading times so that I can be productive without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing libraries THEN tree-shaking friendly imports SHALL be used
2. WHEN loading components THEN dynamic imports SHALL be considered for large components
3. WHEN bundling code THEN unused code SHALL be eliminated through proper tree-shaking
4. WHEN analyzing bundle size THEN significant improvements SHALL be measurable after cleanup
